# Overview

Outsource is an app that brings users who want to find work together with users who need a job completed. It is a platform that allows users to search for jobs that interest them. They can filter tasks based off categories and location in order to find local tasks that best suit their interests.**TO BE IMPLEMENTED

Sourcing work can be difficult, especially when you have a small task that needs to be completed quickly and is once-off. Hence why Outsource is designed for those who want to complete ***tasks.*** This implies the nature of the work being outsourced as shor and infrequent.

It removes the barriers of communication between taskers and taskees. Application forms allow task posters to see who is interested in their task, and give them instant approval or rejection. By having simple features of interaction such as comments and applications, users can interact with each other and get tasks completed.

**Why is this a problem?**

Many existing job boards exist to promote long-term and skilled employment. Sometimes we just need someone to wash our car because we just can't be bothered or don't have the time, let's leave the contracts out of it.

Outsource is a no-frills job app that only asks you to provide a small amount of information about yourself. The program is designed for low-risk jobs that need to be completed quickly. No need to write a cover letter to make money on Outsource.

This website promotes efficient and seamless communication between people who want jobs completed and people who want to complete jobs. We want Outsource to be the digital version of a community job board. This means a simple interface that brings efficient and accurate communication that will bring value to the users.
